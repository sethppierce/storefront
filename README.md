# LAB - Class 36

## Project: StoreFront

### Problem Domain

The problem domain for this React application is a storefront, where users can browse and purchase products. The application will be built in four phases, with Phase 1 focusing on setting up the basic scaffolding and initial styling of the application. The goal is to create a clean and easy-to-use user interface for browsing products.

### Documentation

Documentation for the application can be found in the README file. The prod deployment link, when applicable, will be provided in the "Links and Resources" section.

### Links and Resources

- [prod deployment](spp-storefront.netlify.app) (when applicable)

### Setup

#### How to initialize/run your application (where applicable)

In order to set up and run the application, it should be initialized using create-react-app. Material UI should also be installed as a dependency.

#### Features / Routes

The application will also use a Redux store to manage the state of categories and items in the store. The developer stories and technical requirements for this phase of the project include creating a visually appealing site using Material UI, displaying a list of categories from state, identifying the selected category and showing a list of products associated with the category, and creating a clean and easy-to-use user interface.

#### Tests

Currently there are only tests for our reducer.
